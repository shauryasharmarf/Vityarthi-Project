Student Management System (SMS) Desktop Application

Overview of the Project-

The Student Management System (SMS) is a desktop application designed to streamline the academic tracking process for educators. It provides a centralized database for managing student records, recording attendance, entering subject marks, and automatically calculating final performance grades. The system emphasizes usability and efficiency to reduce administrative overhead.

Features

1.Student CRUD: Add new students with unique IDs, view their details, and delete records.

2.Attendance Module: Record the number of days present out of a total possible days.

3.Marks Module: Enter marks for three subjects: Math, Science, and English.

4.Automatic Grading: Calculates a final grade (A, B, C, F) based on the average marks.

5.Performance Report: Displays a consolidated view of each student's name, ID, attendance percentage, total marks, average, and final grade.


Technologies/Tools Used-


1.Backend/Logic -  Python 3.x - Core programming language for application logic 

2.User Interface (UI) - Tkinter - Standard Python library for creating the graphical desktop interface (UI/UX).

3.Data Storage - JSON (file) - Simple, persistent local storage for student records.

Steps to Install & Run the Project-

1.Prerequisite: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.Download: Save the student_management_app.py file to your local machine.

3.Run: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute the following command:

python student_management_app.py


The Student Management System window should open.

Instructions for Testing

Test Case 1 (Add Student): Click 'Add Student', enter valid data, and verify the student appears in the main list.

Test Case 2 (Update Data): Select a student, click 'Update Data', modify their marks/attendance, and ensure the Grade and Average update correctly in the Report tab.

Test Case 3 (Grade Calculation): Test boundary conditions for marks (e.g., marks resulting in an average of 90, 80, 70) to confirm the A, B, C, F grading logic is sound.
