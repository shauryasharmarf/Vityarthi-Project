Student Management System (SMS) Project Statement


Problem Statement-

In educational institutions, tracking student performance across multiple metrics—specifically attendance, previous examination marks, and final grades—is often fragmented, time-consuming, and prone to manual error. Educators and administrators require a centralized, efficient, and user-friendly desktop application to manage this critical student data effectively, allowing for quick retrieval and performance analysis.

Scope of the Project-

The project will deliver a desktop application built using Python and its standard GUI library, Tkinter. The scope includes:

1.Data Persistence: Storing student records in a structured local file (JSON).

2.CRUD Operations: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records.

3.Core Feature Implementation: Implementing modules for Attendance, Marks Entry, and Performance Reporting.

4.UI/UX Focus: Providing a clear, intuitive, and responsive interface for data entry and visualization.

Target Users-

Teachers/Instructors: To record daily attendance and enter marks for different subjects/exams.

Academic Administrators: To generate summary reports, track student progress, and analyze overall class performance.

High-Level Features-

1.Student Record Management (Add/View/Delete).

2.Daily/Subject-wise Attendance Recording.

3.Marks Entry for three distinct subjects.

4.Automatic Grade Calculation (A, B, C, F) based on average marks.

5.A dedicated Performance Report view showing all key metrics.
